# Stable_diffusion-dreamlikediffusion
google colab notebook for generating txt2image images in either stable diffusion 2.1 model or dreamlike diffusion model 1.0

very basic notebook for ease of use

the model will generate an image from the initial selected seed and save, then the next image will be generated from seed +100
i prefer a low increment increase in the seed for ease of veiwing but can be adjusted in the code
many modifications to come in the future as i embark on my adventure into the world of AI and programming.
Just download and upload into google colab and enjoy
